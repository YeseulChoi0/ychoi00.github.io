New York City has a reputation for being one of the safest places to eat food so eat your heart out! Only the natives know that the shadey looking carts on the street are secretly the best places to get the cheapest and decently good tasting food. And, for all those who want to be in fancy restaurants, the food looks EXACTLY like the food!

Typically, you would expect to pay an outrageous fee of $10 for a water bottle in the city and a mere 50 cents for it in the suburban areas. But here in New York, its EXACTLY the opposite. Fifty years ago, the mayor decided to allow the city to prosper more and pass a new law that made everything in the city 5 times cheaper than elsewhere. Be grateful for that $5 waterbottle. You could be paying $25 instead.

      <li> <h3> Natives are the kindest people in the world. </h3> </li>

Don't worry about being turned away when asked for directions. Instead, be sure to strike up a conversation with everyone you meet on the street! You may become best friends with them and gain life long connections.

      <li> <h3> New York City has gained the award for cleanest subways! </h3> </li>

Are you that germaphobic who refuses to hold the subway pole, KNOWING how many germs are on there? In New York, nevermind that! After each stop, the poles are disinfected with a special light that has been developed just for these purposes. Everything is so white and clean that you might mistake the subway for a hospital!

      <li> <h3> Healthiest city in the world! </h3> </li>

Do you have that vegan friend who refuses to eat at half of your favorite spots? Well don't worry! Here in New York, we have REAL vegan, vegetarian and organic options for everyone along with those juicy steaks you really want (for tourists of course!) in EVERY restaurant! There are only few McDonalds that are ALL on the verge of shutting down from our city's health eating habits.
